Writing is hard. I didn't relaise this until I tried writing for these blog posts, and discovered a few writers whose writing I could really appreciate. I imagine my hubris was largly due to my previous circumstances with writing; they have entierly been in school and for entirely different purposes. while in high school, writing was a chore to get through as quickly as possible so I could spend my time in the "real" schooling, math, chemistry etc. And although I was never a top student in english, I could always get good enough grades with quite little effort. It's not exactly difficlt to blaze through reading a text and scribble down a few paragraphs: into, point1, point2, point3, conclusion (which really is just a rewording of the intro, why??). When I moved to writing in university it was a very similar concept, except instead of a text it was usually some sort of results form experimentation or a lab.
