<h1 class="text-secondary">blog</h1>

<p>
  This blogâ€™s purpose is to give others an insight into what sort of things I find interesting, as well as a place for me to organize my thoughts.
</p>
<p>
  Some of my writings summarize the work of others in cases where I think their ideas are important and I can add some commentary of my own.
</p>
<p>
  Other writings act as a learning tool for myself, especially in cybersecurity; If I can explain it effectively, then it is a good indication that I have a solid grasp of the subject matter.
