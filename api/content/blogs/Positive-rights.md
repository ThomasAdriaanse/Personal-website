When I first read Peter Singer’s “Famine Affluence and Morality” (cite), it made me think a bit harder about how people act in the world. Singer says that if people living in affluence could have a great impact on the lives of the less fortunate, they have a duty to help so long as they give up nothing of comparable significance. One major criticism I hear of the piece has to do with the demandingness of the piece’s conclusion, for in today’s world there are undoubtedly many ways to help the less fortunate with little sacrifice of oneself.
After thinking about this problem, it made me want to think out loud about what sort of moral obligations make sense to me, and how they would change the way most people act on a day-to-day basis.

##Thinking it through
Rights are useful tools which govern actions related to individuals, determining if such an action is moral or not. Most people agree that individuals have negative rights. Not everyone agrees that people have positive rights, and if so to what extent one’s own wellbeing should be sacrificed in service of positive rights. Let’s try to create an equation to help decide what sort of restrictions should be placed on positive rights. Note that this is not about the optimally moral equation, rather the bare minimum to qualify as a moral obligation.
 
##Creating the equation
First let’s figure out why we need positive rights in the first place. What would a moral system look like if the only obligations you had were to not do an action? Well, we could represent that system’s view of positive rights with the following statement:

One is morally obligated to commit an action if
1.  	Never!
Take a hypothetical where you have infinite power and can stop all suffering in the world with very little effort, say, the snap of a finger. Wouldn’t it be evil to not snap your finger when it would be at almost no cost to yourself? I think it clearly is an immoral act, which is why I think I disagree with this moral system.
 
We could theorize that everyone has a duty to others’ wellbeing equally to their own, which would give this statement:

One is morally obligated to commit an action if
2.  	Decrease in my wellbeing < Increase in their wellbeing

This commits all people on earth to a life of slavery where they must spend all of their time caring for the least well-off people in the world. I think it would be virtuous if one did this, however I don’t think it would be an immoral act to be selfish to any amount.
 
What if we take the same statement from before and limit it such that we are only obliged to act if the difference in wellbeing is large enough?

One is morally obligated to commit an action if
3.  	Decrease in my wellbeing + Increase in their wellbeing > x
